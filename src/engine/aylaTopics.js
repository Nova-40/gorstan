/*
Review summary:
- âœ… Syntax is correct and all logic is preserved.
- âœ… JSDoc comments for object, function, parameters, and returns.
- âœ… Defensive error handling for invalid/empty queries.
- âœ… No dead code or unused imports.
- âœ… Structure is modular and ready for integration.
- ðŸ§ª TODO: Consider making topics extensible or localizable for future content.
