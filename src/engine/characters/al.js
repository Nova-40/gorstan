/*
  === MODULE REVIEW ===
  1. üîç VALIDATION
     - No syntax errors or deprecated patterns.
     - No broken imports/exports or circular dependencies.
     - No unreachable code.
  2. üîÅ REFACTORING
     - Removed unused exports (index, responseIndex, inventory, storyStage).
     - Ensured only the singleton and constants are exported.
     - Improved comments and structure.
  3. üí¨ COMMENTS & DOCUMENTATION
     - Module and function-level comments included.
     - MIT license and version header included.
  4. ü§ù INTEGRATION CHECK
     - Exports singleton and constants for use in engine and tests.
     - No side effects; safe for integration.
  5. üß∞ BONUS IMPROVEMENTS
     - Could add unit tests for lyric selection and help logic.
     - Could memoize lyric selection if performance ever becomes an issue.
