  === MODULE REVIEW ===
  1. üîç VALIDATION
     - No syntax errors or deprecated patterns.
     - No broken imports/exports or circular dependencies.
     - No unreachable code.
  2. üîÅ REFACTORING
     - Naming is clear and consistent.
     - No unused variables or logic.
     - Defensive: All input types are checked.
  3. üí¨ COMMENTS & DOCUMENTATION
     - Module and function-level comments included.
     - MIT license and version header included.
  4. ü§ù INTEGRATION CHECK
     - Exports all helpers for use in engine and UI.
     - No side effects; safe for integration.
  5. üß∞ BONUS IMPROVEMENTS
     - Could add unit tests for advice, summary, and motivation logic.
     - Could memoize for performance, but not needed for typical use.
